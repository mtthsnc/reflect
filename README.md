# reflect

A self-improving knowledge loop for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code). Every night it
reads your session transcripts, distills them into **proposed** memories, skills, and docs, and
stages them for review. You approve the good ones; they land in a personal knowledge store that
future sessions **pull from automatically** via a retrieval hook.

The loop, end to end:

```
sessions ──/reflect──▶ queue ──/reflect-review──▶ store ──retrieval hook──▶ future sessions
 (.jsonl)   (nightly,    (you      (promote)      (memories  (top-k injected   (context, no
            queue-only)  approve)                  + docs)    per prompt)       supervision)
```

## Why it scales

The store is **pulled, not preloaded**. Older "load all memories every session" designs grow an
always-on context tax and need constant pruning. Here, a `UserPromptSubmit` hook scores each prompt
against every entry's `description` and injects only the **top-k** matches. The store can grow to
thousands of entries while per-session cost stays flat — and there's no index to babysit.

## Engine vs. data

This repo is the **engine** — skills, scripts, the hook, config template. It contains **no personal
data**. Everything you generate (memories, queue, digests, logs, cursor) lives under
`~/.claude/reflection/`, outside the repo. So you can push this to GitHub and share it with
colleagues with zero risk of leaking your own memories.

## Install

Requires: Claude Code CLI on `PATH`, `python3`, `bash`.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mtthsnc/reflectr && cd reflectr
./install.sh --cron          # skills + data dirs + retrieval hook + nightly cron
```

Flags: `--no-hook` (skip the retrieval hook), `--cron` (install the 02:30 nightly job),
`--force` (overwrite an existing `config.json` with the template). Re-run any time — it's
idempotent, so `git pull && ./install.sh` updates everything in place (skills are symlinked).

Restart open Claude Code sessions afterward so the hook loads.

## Use

- **`/reflect`** — run the distiller now (or let cron do it nightly). Stages candidates, writes a
  digest under `~/.claude/reflection/digests/`, never writes live.
- **`/reflect-review`** — review the queue and promote what you approve into the store.
- After that, just work. The retrieval hook surfaces relevant memories in future prompts on its own.

## Configure

Edit `~/.claude/reflection/config.json` (generated from `config.example.json`):

- `scan.*` — which projects/transcripts to read, min session size, first-run lookback.
- `retrieval.top_k` / `min_score` / `max_chars_per_entry` — how much the hook injects per prompt.
  Set `hook_enabled: false` to mute retrieval without uninstalling.
- `thresholds.*` — caps on candidates per run; how often a workflow must recur to become a skill.

## Uninstall

```bash
./uninstall.sh            # removes skills links, hook, cron — keeps your data
./uninstall.sh --purge    # also deletes ~/.claude/reflection (your memories!)
```

## How retrieval works (and its limits)

`hooks/retrieve.py` is stdlib-only keyword overlap: it weights matches in an entry's `description`
(4×) and `name` (2×) over its body (1×), and injects the top-k above `min_score`. It **never blocks
a prompt** — any error exits silently. It's deliberately simple; swapping in embeddings is the
natural upgrade if keyword recall starts missing synonyms. See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`.
